#####    Principles of Analytic Graphics    #####
#################################################


### 1: Show Comparisons

# Evidence for a hypothesis is always relative to another competing hypothesis.
# E.g. when trying to measure an effect it is important to compare it to a
# control group or something similar.
# Always ask: "compared to what?"


### 2: Show Causality, Mechanisms, Explanations, Systematic Structure

# Whats your causal framework for thinking about a question? What are possible
# explanations for the result? Don't just show the end result. Show what lead
# to your conclusion and what might explain the end result.
# In a complex system often many different factors are involved and have an
# impact. Those mechanisms and the systems structure are key.


### 3: Show Multivariate Data

# The real world is multivariate! Show as many variables are reasonable to get
# a clear and comprehensive picture of whats happening.


### 4: Integrate Evidence

# Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams.
# Make use of many modes of presentation.
# Don't let the tools drive the analysis.


### 5: Describe and Document the Evidence 

# This includes using appropriate labels, scales, and documenting sources. Doing
# this makes it easier to reproduce the result and is important for credibility.


### 6: Content is King!

# Analytical presentations stand and fall with the quality, relevance, and 
#integrity of their content.
