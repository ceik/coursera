# Statistical Inference: Generating colclusions about a population from a noisy
#                        sample.
#
# It goes beyond the data to generate new knowledge.

# This class focusses on frequentist style statistics as opposed to e.g.
# Bayesian statistics.

# Frequency Probability: Is the long run proportion of times an event occurs in 
#                        independent, identically distributed repetitions.
# Frequency Style Inference: Uses frequency interpretations of probabilities to 
#                            control error rates. Answers questions like "What 
#                            should I decide given my data controlling the long 
#                            run proportion of mistakes I make at a tolerable 
#                            level."

# Bayesian Probability: Is the probability calculus of beliefs, given that 
#                       beliefs follow certain rules.
# Bayesian Style Inference: The use of Bayesian probability representation of 
#                           beliefs to perform inference. Answers questions like
#                           "Given my subjective beliefs and the objective 
#                           information from the data, what should I believe now?"
