# getdata_course_project

Repo for Getting and Cleaning Data course project.

run_analysis.R is a script that combines a bunch of data files from this source:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

It also formats it, removes some column, and aggregates the remaining data.

For the script to run the data folder "UCI HAR Dataset" needs to contain all the files from the source and be in the working directory.
