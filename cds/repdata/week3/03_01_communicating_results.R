### tl;dr

# Results are often first presented via email. Since people are busy it is often
# very helpful to break results down into different levels of granularity.

### Hierachy of Information for a Paper

# 1. Title
# 2. Abstract
# 3. Body & Results
# 4. Supplementary materials, the gory details
# 5. Code & Data, the really gory details


### Hierachy of Information for an Email

# 1. Subject: Summarize the findings if possible
# 2. Body: Brief description of the problem & context. Recall what was proposed
#          and executed. Summarize findings. 1-2 paragraphs.
#          Action points should be as concrete as possible. Questions ideally be
#          yes/no.
# 3. Attachments: R Markdown or knitr file. This can be longer, but still should
#                 not contain all code/data.
# 4. Supplementary Material: Code/Software/Data. Link to github/website.

# This is very analoguous to the research paper! Different people are interested
# in different levels of details. You need to speak on all of these levels to 
# get people to care.
