#####    Evidence Based Data Analysis    #####

### Replication

# Is the ultimate standard for research. It focuses on the validity of the 
# scientific claim and requires new investigators, new data, new methods. new
# labs, new instruments, etc. It is especially important for policy or regula-
# tory descisions with a broad impact.


### Reproducibility

# Is the minimum standard for any research. It focuses on the validity of the
# data analysis and only requres new investigators, while the same data and
# methods are used. It is very important when replication is impossible.


### Background and Underlying Trends

# Some studies can not be replicated because they are unique or there are time/
# money constraints. 
#
# Technology makes data bigger and high-dimensional, while allowing more
# sophisticated analysis. Also databases can be merged more easily and data is
# more often used off-label (e.g. administrative data for health research).
#
# For every field X there is Computational X.


### The Result of These Trends?

# Heavy computational requirements for people without adequate training is 
# statistics and computing. This makes things more error-prone and less trust-
# worthy


### What Does Reproducibility Solve?

# 1. Transparency
# 2. Data Availability
# 3. Software/Methods Availability
# 4. Improved Knowledge Transfer


### Problems with Reproducibility

# It does not ensure validity/correctness of the analysis. There are many 
# examples in literature, where results were reproducible but wrong.
#
# It is based on the premise that people can check each others work and the
# whole system will become self-correcting in the long run. However this does 
# not completely deter people from doing bad analysis. Also it assumes that
# everyone plays by the same rules and wants to achieve the same goal.


### Evidence-Based Methodology

# Data Analysis often involves many different tools and methods. Some of them 
# may be standard while other are ad-hoc. However ideally only thoroughly
# studied and mutually agreed upon methods should be used whenever possible.
# If you deviate from standard it should be justifiable.


### Evidence-Based Data Analysis

# The idea is to create an analytic pipeline from evidence-based components. 
# Once this is established, it should not be messed with anymore. It becomes a
# transparent box in which the researcher is not allowed to tinker with the 
# parameters anymore.

# Reproducible research focusses on making the "downstream" (after publication)
# aspect easier/more throrough. A standardized toolbox for the analytic pipe-
# line would make the "upstream" (data processing, etc) part safer.
